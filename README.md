# Web APIs

This repo is for me to experiment with and learn more about interacting with APIs.

### Main takeaways:

Working with APIs is actually damn simple, and there's nothing to be afraid of.

1. Choose the API to work with
2. Read the API documentation
3. Start with small code, and complement it with more features
