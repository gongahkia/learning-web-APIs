# Chess bot

> *Edit on 3/4/2023:* Will return to this project when I have figured out how to click on chess squares in the Lichess website in actual games. PyautoGUI to guesstimate each square's location is an inadequate solution.

This project was borne out of a culmination of my frustration at learning [*Rust lang*](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and my inability to complete [*Advent of Code 2022 Day 8*](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8) in C++. I am broken and defeated. All that is left is to conquer.
